My research interests include distributed algorithms with an emphasis on Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus, and shared randomness. 
I am particularly interested in such protocols in asynchronous and partially synchronous networks.

Recently, I've also been researching cryptography in distributed protocols, and the way these fields interact with each other.

I am a PostDoc working with <a href='https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/'>Rafael Pass</a> in Tel Aviv University. 
My PhD advisors were <a href='https://research.vmware.com/researchers/ittai-abraham'>Ittai Abraham</a> and <a href='https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/'>Danny Dolev</a>.
